# movTindrr
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/03/13/introducing-create-react-native-app.html)

This app allows people to swipe right or left on their favorite movies. It has got the look and feel of Tinder. Users will also be able to get information on the movie. the trailer is also embedded within the information. 

# Boot the app
This app is cross compatible and can be run on all devices. To run it on a computer, first things first, set up your computer so that it can run RN apps by installing all the development tools. Once you have the development tools, just type `npm run ios` for iOS or `npm run android` or to run it on expo, just type `npm start` and once the QR code shows up, just scan that with your phone.

# Demo
Here is a demo of the final version of the app:
